# AI-Driven Career Recommendation Platform

## Project Overview
The AI-Driven Career Recommendation Platform is a web application designed to help recent university graduates explore personalised career paths based on their skills, interests, and job market trends. By integrating AI-powered career matching and real-time job data, this platform provides career roadmaps, skill gap analysis, and AI-generated resume suggestions.

## Features

- Matches jobs based on AI career recommendations.

### AI-Powered Resume & Cover Letter Helper
- Uses GPT-4 to generate and improve CVs and cover letters.
- Tailors resumes to match specific job descriptions.

### Career Progression Roadmap
- Shows career growth paths (e.g., Junior → Mid-Level → Senior).
- Displays required skills at each stage.

### Skill Gap Analysis
- Compares user's skills vs. job requirements.
- Suggests online courses (LinkedIn Learning API integration planned).

### Personality-Based Career Matching
- Uses IBM Watson Personality Insights API (or similar) to suggest careers based on personality traits.
